1. Make it so the game window can be resized or switched to fullscreen mode. Then game grid should fit to screen. If it's impossibe, remain dark gray areas on the screen.
2. If the grid size gets bigger or smaller, everything else remains with its default size and gets disproportionate. These elements are particles, snake eyes, grid borders and other stuff. Make that when the grid size gets bigger or smaller, everything else is getting properly proportional to it.
3. Let's make the apple animation. Make that when the player gets close to the apple (5 cells from head), the apple decides a new position to generate at. And particles start to spawn at that position to indicate new apple position. If the player gets too far (more than 5 cells), particles should stop spawning. If the player gets close again after getting too far, the apple should decide a new position to generate at, spawning new particles at it. If the player eats the apple, particles should stop spawning and the apple appearing animation should start. It should look like the small apple smoothly gets bigger before it reaches its default size.
